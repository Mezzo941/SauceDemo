# HOW TO RUN TESTS FROM COMMAND LINE?
## 1. UPDATE LIBRERIES
- To update all the libraries helping run the tests use the **"mvn versions: display-dependency-updates command"** in the command line. 
 
 ## NOTE: Don't forget to move to the project directory else you will get something like this: 
 
 [INFO] BUILD FAILURE
 
 [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:versions-maven-plugin:2.8.1:display-dependency-updates (default-cli): Goal requires a project to execute but there is no POM in this directory (E:\). Please verify you invoked Maven from the correct directory. -> [Help 1]
